# Clarke Titling

On a random Tuesday, I saw the cover of one of Arthur C. Clarke's books and wondered what the fonts were. When the usual font-identifying sites couldn't identify them from the images, I thought they needed more precise examples and redrew them.

And that's how we ended up here.

## Disclaimer

This initial version is extremely basic. It contains only Latin uppercase and a period.

No numbers, no kerning, not much of anything.

## Fonts

Clarke Titling consists of a web font and OpenType font in a single weight in sans and serif styles.

Look in the `fonts/otf/` folder for the desktop fonts, and the `fonts/webfonts/` folder for the web fonts.
